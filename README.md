## 🧭 Which Package Should I Use?

Decide based on your framework and the level of UI control you need:

| Framework      | Quickest Integration (UI + Logic)       | Custom UI (Hooks / Logic Only)             | Core Only (Vanilla JS)          |
| :------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- | :------------------------------ |
| **React**      | `@tronweb3/tronwallet-adapter-react-ui` | `@tronweb3/tronwallet-adapter-react-hooks` | —                               |
| **Vue**        | `@tronweb3/tronwallet-adapter-vue-ui`   | `@tronweb3/tronwallet-adapter-vue-hooks`   | —                               |
| **Vanilla JS** | —                                       | —                                          | `@tronweb3/tronwallet-adapters` |

## 🔌 Supported Wallets

We support a wide range of TRON and EVM wallets, including TronLink, MetaMask, WalletConnect, Ledger, and [more](https://walletadapter.org/docs/guide/wallet-reference.html#supported-wallets-by-adapter). Each adapter offers a consistent interface — use the collective `@tronweb3/tronwallet-adapters` package and import individual adapters.

👉 For the complete list of supported wallets and their adapters, visit our [documentation](https://walletadapter.org/docs/guide/wallet-reference.html#supported-wallets-by-adapter).

> **Note**: In case wallet developers intend to release breaking changes, you can [open an issue here](https://github.com/tronweb3/tronwallet-adapter/issues/new) to inform us, thus enabling us to update the new protocols accordingly.

### Add support for new wallet

Follow these steps to support new wallets:

1. List your wallet to [Tron Wallet](https://tron.network/wallet) .
2. Open an issue in this repository or fork the repository and implement the according adapter.

### Wallet Integration Standards

Wallets are encouraged to implement the following TRON interface standards to ensure compatibility with the TronWallet Adapter and the broader TRON dApp ecosystem:

-   [TIP-1193](https://github.com/tronprotocol/tips/blob/master/tip-1193.md) – Defines a standard TRON provider interface for dApps to communicate with wallets.

By following these standards, wallets can be seamlessly integrated into modern TRON dApps using unified APIs and adapters.

## 🚀 Development & Contributing

We welcome contributions! To get started with the codebase:

### Prerequisites

-   **Node.js**: 24.19.0 — pinned in [`.nvmrc`](.nvmrc); `nvm use` in the repo root picks it up
-   **pnpm**: 11.21.0 — pinned by `packageManager` in the root `package.json`

### Local Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/tronweb3/tronwallet-adapter.git

# 2. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 3. Build all packages
pnpm build

# 4. Start the development demo
pnpm example  # Runs our pre-built React/Vite example
```

### Commands

-   `pnpm watch`: Rebuild packages automatically on change.
-   `pnpm lint`: Run ESLint across all workspaces.
-   `pnpm test`: Run unit tests.
-   `pnpm update-version`: Update package versions for release.

## 🧪 End-to-End Testing

End-to-end tests live in a companion repository. It is **not** cloned automatically — fetch it into the `e2e/` directory (via `scripts/sync-e2e.js`) by running this from the repo root:

```bash
pnpm e2e:update
```

This clones the repo on first run and pulls the latest changes afterwards. Then install its dependencies inside `e2e/` (see the Quick Start below). You do not need to clone it manually.

```
tronwallet-adapter/
└── e2e/          ← automatically fetched e2e repository
    └── tron/
        ├── e2e-shared/   # shared Playwright fixtures, specs, and page harness
        ├── tronlink/     # TronLink-specific tests
        └── <walletId>/   # other wallet test packages
```

### Quick Start

> **Before running the tests**, build the adapters from the `tronwallet-adapter` repo root so the suite picks up the current code:
>
> ```bash
> pnpm build:ts
> ```

All setup commands run from the `e2e/` directory. Extension IDs are looked up automatically — you do not need to copy-paste them. For the full list of supported `walletId` values, see [e2e/README.md → Supported Wallets](https://github.com/tronweb3/tronwallet-adapter-e2e/blob/main/README.md#supported-wallets).

> The e2e workspace requires **Node 22.17.0** (pinned in `e2e/.nvmrc`). The `nvm use` command below is only for [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) users — if you manage Node another way, just make sure your active version is 22.17.0 before continuing.

```bash
# 1. Enter the e2e root and switch to the required Node version
cd e2e
nvm use 22.17.0   # nvm users only — otherwise ensure Node 22.17.0 some other way

# 2. Install pnpm 9.6.0 (skip if already installed), then the dependencies, and build
npm install -g pnpm@9.6.0
pnpm install
pnpm build

# 3. Install the Playwright browser (Chromium) that drives the wallet extension
pnpm --filter ./tron/tronlink exec playwright install chromium

# 4. One-time: create the shared tron/.env (skip if it already exists)
pnpm e2e:init --init-env

# 5. One-time: copies the extension, initialises the env, and opens Chromium.
#    In the browser: import your seed phrase, set a password, switch to Nile testnet, close.
pnpm e2e:init tronlink

# 6. One-time: after the browser closes, copy the wallet profile into the project.
pnpm e2e:init tronlink --copy-profile

# 7. Edit e2e/tron/.env and set WALLET_PASSWORD to the password from step 5.
#    Then verify the environment is ready.
pnpm e2e:init tronlink --verify
```

Because `e2e/` is a **pnpm workspace**, you can run tests for any wallet directly from the `e2e/` root — no need to `cd` into each wallet's directory:

```bash
# Run tests for a single wallet (from e2e/ root)
pnpm --filter ./tron/tronlink e2e

# Filter by test name
pnpm --filter ./tron/tronlink e2e --grep "E2E-SEC"

# Run tests for all wallets sequentially (one wallet at a time)
pnpm e2e:all
```

### Testing Against a Local Adapter Build

Set `WALLET_ADAPTERS_PATH` in `e2e/tron/.env` to point to your local checkout so Vite serves your in-progress changes instead of the published npm package:

```env
# e2e/tron/.env
WALLET_ADAPTERS_PATH=../packages/adapters/adapters/src/index.ts   # resolved relative to e2e/
WALLET_PASSWORD=your_test_wallet_password
```

Then rebuild the adapter and re-run tests:

```bash
# In tronwallet-adapter root
pnpm build

# In e2e/tron/tronlink (or any wallet)
pnpm e2e
```
